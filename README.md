Apocalypse Weapons 

Welcome to the zombie apocalypse weapons gem. This gem provides a user with a collection of the ideal weapons for somebody to possess during a zombie apocalypse. Weapons are grouped into two categories, firearms and melee weapons. A user can select to view a weapons list based on a specific category, and then select a weapon to view further information on. The information that a user can view about a selected weapon includes a name and description. Additionally, a user can view a bit of history about melee weapons, is provided with a link to view further information on every firearm upon selection, and is also provided with a link to buy the selected melee weapon from amazon.
